{"pageProps":{"title":"English","content":"### The problem\nYou are at the B2 (upper-intermediate) level. You've spent months learning English, but it looks like you are not making progress.\n\n### The most useful actions\n1. Find a teacher who has a teaching skill. Google CELTA or DELTA.\n2. Study at least three times per week. The more lessons per week you have, the better.\n3. Four lessons of 30 minutes per week are better than two lessons of 60 minutes per week.\n4. Take a course in Business English.\n5. If you see a new word, phrase, or idiom, don't translate it into your native language. Try to understand it from the context. If it doesn't work, look into [Longman Dictionary](https://www.ldoceonline.com) and read explanations and examples in English.\n6. Don't learn grammar deliberately, but remember the whole phrases instead.\n\nThat's it!\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
