Maintainability.\n\n#### Reliability properties\n1. Tolerance to user input errors.\n2. Tolerance to individual server outages.\n3. Tolerance to human mistakes.\n\n#### Scalability properties\n1. Scaling each 10x users will likely require architecture changes.\n2. Response time of 99.9 percentile is usually a good enough measure of system responsiveness.\n3. Distinguish latency (server time) and response (server + roundtrip time) time.\n\n#### Maintainability properties\n1. Easy to understand code.\n2. Easy to make changes.\n3. Easy to run in production (operations).\n\n#### See also\n- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321)\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
