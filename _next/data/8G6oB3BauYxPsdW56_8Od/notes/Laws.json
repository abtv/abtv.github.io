{"pageProps":{"title":"Laws","content":"### Abilene fallacy\n  This is a collective fallacy, in which a group of people collectively decide on a course of action that is counter to the preferences of most or all individuals in the group, while each individual believes it to be aligned with the preferences of most of the others. It involves a breakdown of group communication in which each member mistakenly believes that their own preferences are counter to the group's, and therefore does not raise objections, or even states support for an outcome they do not want.\n### Brooks\n  Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.\n### Campbell\n  The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor.\n### Conway\n  Organisations which design systems  are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organisations.\n### Goodhart\n  When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\n### Little\n  The long-term average number L of customers in a stationary system is equal to the long-term average effective arrival rate λ multiplied by the average time W that a customer spends in the system.\n### Occam’s Razor\n  The simplest solution is most likely the right one.\n### Order of Priorities\n  1. Make it working in at least 90% cases.\n  2. Fix bugs to make it working in 99.99% of cases.\n  3. Make it working faster.\n### Parkinson\n  An observation that the duration of a task expands to fill its allotted time span, regardless of the amount of work to be done.\n  Members of an organisation give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.\n### Peter principle\n  Employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
