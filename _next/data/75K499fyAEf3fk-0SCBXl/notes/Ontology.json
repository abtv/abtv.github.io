Type defines what we can do with the object.\n\n- Physical object: has 4d representation in space and time, object is finite.\n- Class: a set of objects which are grouped using some property value.\n- Tuple: it's 3 items: object, relation, another object. Order is important.\n\nDon't forget to clarify what this word is referring to. It may be a source for an error: you may use the same word as your colleague but have a different object in your mind.\n\n\n### 2. Explanation\nDesired properties of an explanation:\n1. It is close to reality: we can explain something with narrow classes or physical objects.\n2. It has details.\n3. Refutability: we know in which circumstances our explanation will be false. The more such ways we find the better. To find the ways we need to answer the following question: what should happen to make our explanation false?\n\nMnemonic technique: it's easier to remember facts if we put the facts into a narrative (story): *somebody* doing *something*. Something is your facts.\n\n\n### 3. Roles\nEach role has:\n1. Objects of interest: what objects are picked out from background.\n2. Preferences.\n3. Intentions: what the role is going to do with its objects of interest to satisfy its preferences.\n\n\n### 4. Goal-oriented communication\nTODO\n\n### 5. Communication failures\n#### 5. 1. Communication was ended by another person\n- goal is not clear for another person: talk about what another person wants from the communication.\n- goal is clear for another person but it's value is less than efforts: ask another person if it's true.\n- another person lost their attention: give them time to recover.\n\n#### 5.2. Communication is continuing but you haven't reached your goal\n- *you* have an illusion of a common goal: talk if you have a common goal.\n- another person changes their role: need to ask which role are they playing at the moment or ask if they are talking from *this* role; you may also ask what is the most interesting things for them here.\n- object of communication is not clear or language is not clear: talk about what these words reference to.\n\n\n### See also\n- [Chris Partridge: # Business Objects: Re-Engineering for Re-Use](https://www.amazon.com/Business-Objects-Re-Engineering-Computer-Professional/dp/075062082X)\n- [David Deutsch: The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes--and Its Implications](https://www.amazon.com/Fabric-Reality-Parallel-Universes-Implications/dp/014027541X)\n\n### Related links\n- [Life &rarr;](/notes/Life)"},"__N_SSG":true}
