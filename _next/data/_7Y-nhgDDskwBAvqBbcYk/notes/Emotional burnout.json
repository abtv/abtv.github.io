I constantly feel that I'm tired and start to have diseases related to my professional activity.\n4. I feel that I hate my profession and other people who I work with.

Don't learn new things related to work, don't learn new languages, etc. Just forget about my work.\n\n### 3rd stage treatment\nTake a sabbatical. Usually it's from 3 to 6 months.\n\n### 4th stage treatment\nChange profession.\n\n### What to remember when I feel bad\nI'm more than just a professional.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
