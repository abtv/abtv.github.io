What should I learn?\n3. How should I learn?\n\nWithout answering these questions (in this order!) it's very likely I will spend my time in vain.\n\n### Important notes\n- Watching videos on YouTube usually is not learning. Learning changes our behavior, watching videos doesn't.\n- Reading books usually is not learning if I don't practice what I learned.\n- If I don't practice what I learned I will forget it.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
