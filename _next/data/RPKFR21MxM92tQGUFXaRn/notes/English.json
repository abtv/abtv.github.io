{"pageProps":{"title":"English","content":"Using English at work may be the best way to improve your English. There are other ways, especially if you want to learn a lot of new words and phrases.\n\n### How to train writing\nWrite a blog. Like this one.\n\n\n### How to learn new words\n1. Read news in English. I started reading [Euronews](https://www.euronews.com) and [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/international) and then started to explore more news sites. It's important to read non-technical topics: you will learn more new words and phrases.\n2. Take an intermediate, upper-intermediate, or advanced course of English and do all the exercises. I'm currently going through upper-intermediate course at [Yandex practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/english). Then I'm going to return to \"English vocaulary in use advanced\" and maybe go through intermediate course on Yandex practicum in parallel. \n\n\n### How to train speaking and listening\n1. I usually search \"news\" on YouTube in the morning and watch something interesting while I'm making my breakfast.\n2. Find a native speaker on Italki or Preply. Practice at least 2 times per week, one hour at a time. This is important for upper-intermediate level and above.\n3. Watch Scrubs, Morning Show, any other interesting TV-series without subtitles. Switch movies from time to time because it's necessary to learn new accents to improve listening skill."},"__N_SSG":true}
