{"pageProps":{"title":"Learning","content":"#### Key principles\n#### 1. Define your goal\nIt's OK if you don't know yet what you want.\n\nTry different things. The more you try the better you will understand what you want. \n\nWhen you find something interesting write down what exactly you want to achieve and how to understand that you achieved it.\n\nThen check if this goal drives you. If not probably it's not your real goal.\n\n#### 2. Create a learning plan\nWrite down intermediate steps, each of which you can achieve in about a week. You need to break one big goal into several steps. Step is small if you can achieve it in a day or less.\n\nThen think about resources you have: how much time and money can you afford to spend on the intermediate steps?\n\nYour plan must include reading (like books or manuals), thinking about the material and practicing (like coding or experimenting). You **need** to make mistakes: this is a way how people learn.\n\n#### 3. Create a habit of learning\nAllocate at least 30-60 minutes every day (depends on resources which you have).\n\nThe clearer your intermediate steps the easier to follow the system. Remember that system is important: regularity and plan will allow you to focus on learning instead of thinking what to do next. Check [Goal vs system &rarr;](/notes/Goal%20vs%20system) for details.\n\n#### Tips\n1. Separate planning and learning. For example, plan on Saturday and learn from Monday to Friday.\n2. Have at least one day of rest every week. For example, no learning on Sunday.\n3. Plan every week. You need to prepare a weekly list of small clear goals.\n4. Don't change your goals during learning days. Postpone it to planning day.\n5. No multitasking during planning or learning.\n\n#### Related notes\n- [Goal vs system &rarr;](/notes/Goal%20vs%20system)"},"__N_SSG":true}
