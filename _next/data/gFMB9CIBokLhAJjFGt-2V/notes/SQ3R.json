{"pageProps":{"title":"SQ3R","content":"### SQ3R\nThis is an algorithm which helps to read difficult texts by keeping your focus on the topic.\n\nIt consists of the following steps:\n- (S)urvey - quickly scan through text.\n- Write down (Q)uestions - based on your quick scan from the previous step.\n- (R)ead text trying to answer your questions.\n- (R)ecall text: remember and say aloud (or in your head) the most important parts.\n- (R)eview text: almost the same as recall but done after some time.\n\n### How I use it\nI quickly scan table of contents or a separate chapter and if I feel an interest in some particular sentence, table or diagram I make a note either by writing down or in my head (only if it's something so extraordinary so I can't forget about it). When I finish scanning I start to read only relevant parts of a book or an article.\n\n### See also\n- [SQ3R on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R)"},"__N_SSG":true}
