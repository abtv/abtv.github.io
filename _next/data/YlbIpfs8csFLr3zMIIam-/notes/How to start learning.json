{"pageProps":{"title":"How to start learning","content":"### Important questions\nBefore starting learning I try to answer the following questions in this order:\n1. Why should I learn?\n2. What should I learn?\n3. How should I learn?\n\nWithout answering these questions (in this order!) it's very likely I will spend my time in vain.\n\n### Important notes\n- Watching videos on YouTube usually is not learning. Learning changes our behavior, watching videos doesn't.\n- Reading books usually is not learning if you don't practice what you learned.\n- If I don't practice what you learned I will forget it.\n- If I don't practice then actually it's hard to say I learned something.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
