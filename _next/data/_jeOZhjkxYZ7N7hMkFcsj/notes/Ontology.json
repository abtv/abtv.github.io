Type defines what we can do with the object.\n\n- Physical object: has 4d representation in space and time, object is finite.\n- Class: a set of objects which are grouped using some property value.\n- Tuple: it's 3 items: object, relation, another object. Order is important.\n- Description: TODO\n- Explanation: TODO\n\n\n### 2. Description\nTODO\n\n\n### 3. Explanation\nDesired properties of an explanation:\n1. It is close to reality: we can explain something with narrow classes or physical objects.\n2. It has details.\n3. Refutability: we know in which circumstances our explanation will be false. The more such ways we find the better. To find the ways we need to answer the following question: what should happen to make our explanation false?\n\nMnemonic technique: it's easier to remember facts if we put the facts into a narrative (story): *somebody* doing *something*. Something is your facts.\n\n### 4. Description corresponding to requirements\nTODO\n\n\n### See also\n- [Chris Partridge: # Business Objects: Re-Engineering for Re-Use](https://www.amazon.com/Business-Objects-Re-Engineering-Computer-Professional/dp/075062082X)\n- [David Deutsch: The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes--and Its Implications](https://www.amazon.com/Fabric-Reality-Parallel-Universes-Implications/dp/014027541X)\n\n### Related links\n- [Life &rarr;](/notes/Life)"},"__N_SSG":true}
