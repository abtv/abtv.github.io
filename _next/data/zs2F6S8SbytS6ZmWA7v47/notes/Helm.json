When chart is first deployed it has release number 1. Each upgrade or rollback increases release number.\n- Repository is a place where charts are being stored and shared.\n- Rollback. Release can be rolled back to the previous (or specific) version number.\n- Values file is a file which puts its configuration values to appropriate places in templates overriding default values.\n\n#### Commands\n- create: creates a chart with a given name.\n- get all: returns all information for a given release name.\n- history: shows recent version numbers of a given release.\n- install: installs a chart to a Kubernetes cluster.\n- list: lists all releases in a given Kubernetes cluster.\n- rolback: rollbacks release to one if the previous versions.\n- show all: shows all information of the chart including values.\n- status: shows current status of a release; it's useful when installing a chart with big Docker images because Helm will not wait when they are downloaded.\n- uninstall: uninstalls a release.\n- upgrade: upgrades already installed chart.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
