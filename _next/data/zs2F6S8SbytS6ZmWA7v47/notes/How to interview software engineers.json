{"pageProps":{"title":"How to interview software engineers","content":"### Define your goal as an employer\nWrite down what you expect from a new employee. Everything else is nice but usually not relevant.\n\n\n### Ask open questions\nIt is better to ask open questions than closed ones, at least for middle-level positions and higher: you will see how many aspects your candidate may reason about and you can always ask specific questions when needed.\n\n\n### Examples of open questions\n#### 1. Technical open questions\nYou goal here is to assess breadth and depth of candidate's technical skills. Remember: you need to match it to your job requirements.\n- When to use and when to avoid michroservice architecture?\n- What was the most interesting project you was working on?\n- What was the most challenging task you solved recently?\n- Your manager asks you to help with a legacy code with many bugs. What are you going to do?\n\n#### 2. Soft-skills open questions\nYou goal here is to understand how your candidate works in a team.\n- You are working on a task and you realise it's much harder than you expected. What you are going to do about it?\n- You need to learn something new. What will you do?\n- Our important client complains that our application works slow and your manager asks you to help. What you are going to do?"},"__N_SSG":true}
