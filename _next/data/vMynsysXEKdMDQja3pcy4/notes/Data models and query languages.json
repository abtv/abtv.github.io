{"pageProps":{"title":"Data models and query languages","content":"#### Data models\n1. Relational: when we need transactions and simple (to some extent) query language. Data is normalized.\n2. Document: when we don't need a strict schema and can store most of necessary data in one document. Connected documents are rare.\n3. Graph: when we don't need a strict schema and we have many connected items.\n\n#### Query languages\n1. Declarative: easier to read (because it's close to a natural language) and optimize (because storage details are hidden).\n2. Imperative: harder to read (because it's close to a programming language) and optimize but these languages are more expressive than declarative ones.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
