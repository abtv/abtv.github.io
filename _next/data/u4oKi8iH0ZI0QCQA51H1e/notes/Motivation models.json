{"pageProps":{"title":"Motivation models","content":"### 1. People are motivated by their needs\nIdea: Basic needs serve as the foundation for motivation.\n\nDrawback: This model does not account for situations where individuals consider long-term outcomes and sacrifice immediate needs.\n\n### 2. People are motivated by carrots and sticks\nIdea: People strive for pleasure while avoiding punishment. Whenever possible, allow individuals to choose how they approach boring tasks.\n\nDrawbacks:\n- Creates an addiction to monetary rewards, as the path to achieving them is clear.\n- Suppresses internal motivation.\n- Stifles creativity.\n- Leads to inertia in thinking.\n\n### 3. People are motivated by engaging and meaningful work\nIdea: People prefer to work in a \"flow\" state, where tasks are challenging enough to avoid boredom but not so difficult that they induce anxiety.\n\nThis concept takes work-related maturity into account. The best results occur in the flow state when tasks are balancedâ€”challenging enough to engage, yet not so overwhelming that they cause stress or anxiety.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
