<p>Redis is an in-memory database. Usually it is used as a secondary database.</p>
<h3>Use cases</h3>
<ol>
<li>Cache.</li>
<li>Queue.</li>
<li>Message broker.</li>
<li>Rate-limiter.</li>
<li>Atomic counters.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Protocol</h3>
<p>Redis uses a simple text protocol for issuing and receiving commands.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Redis uses a single thread to execute commands. It is a design choice.</p>
<h3>Transactions</h3>
<p>It is NOT the same transaction as in a relational database. If one command in a transaction fails all the other transactions WILL be executed (there is no rollback).</p>
<p>Using &quot;Multi, commands list, Exec&quot; Redis guarantees that these commands will be run one after another and all other commands will be run either before or after the commands.</p>
<p>Multi starts queuing consequent commands. Exec runs their execution.</p>
<p>WATCH in combination with EXEC is used for optimistic locking. If one of watched keys was modified EXEC will fail.</p>
<p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/transactions">Transactions</a></p>
<h3>Message broker</h3>
<p>We can send a message to a channel. One channel has several subscribers. Commands are: subscribe, unsubscribe and publish.</p>
<h3>Special data types</h3>
<p>Bitmap for bit operations to save memory.
HyperLogLog for probabalistic counting of unique elements in a set to save memory.</p>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p>Redis database snapshots (RDB):
Stores data in-memory and saves the memory snapshot to disk from time to time as an RDB file. It uses forked process to create a snapshot, so it does not affect performace of the original process. Fork uses copy-on-write, so it is fast.</p>
<p>Append-only file (AOF):
Writes all commands issued against the Redis server. The file will be big because one value stored is only once but may be modified many times (there is a command to rewrite the file when it becomes too big). Durability depends how often you call fsync.</p>
<p>Restoring from RDB snapshot is faster than applying AOF.</p>

<p><a href="http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html">Redis persistence demystified</a></p>
<h3>Roundtrip time (RTT) and pipelinening</h3>
<p>When a command is sent the client is blocked until we get a response from the redis server. If we want to avoid the roundtrip time we need to send all commands at a time or use batches. This feature is called pipelining.</p>
<h3>Availability and failover</h3>
<p>Redis uses replicas to support high availability.
We need one primary node, one replica and at least 3 Sentinel instances to have a quorum. Sentinel instances may be run on the same machine as Redis. For big installations we may want to have 2 big Redis machines and 3 small Sentinel machines.
Redis uses asynchronous replication: if master fails then replica may be slightly outdated.</p>
<p>Redis uses shards to scale horizontally. Cluster is a collection of shards.</p>
<h3>Operating system support</h3>
<ol>
<li>Linux is recommended.</li>
<li>Mac OS.</li>
