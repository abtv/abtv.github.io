People are motivated by their needs</h3>
<p>Idea: Basic needs serve as the foundation for motivation.</p>
<p>Drawback: This model does not account for situations where individuals consider long-term outcomes and sacrifice immediate needs.</p>
<h3>2. People are motivated by carrots and sticks</h3>
<p>Idea: People strive for pleasure while avoiding punishment. Whenever possible, allow individuals to choose how they approach boring tasks.</p>
<p>Drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creates an addiction to monetary rewards, as the path to achieving them is clear.</li>
<li>Suppresses internal motivation.</li>
<li>Stifles creativity.</li>
<li>Leads to inertia in thinking.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. People are motivated by engaging and meaningful work</h3>
<p>Idea: People prefer to work in a &quot;flow&quot; state, where tasks are challenging enough to avoid boredom but not so difficult that they induce anxiety.</p>
<p>This concept takes work-related maturity into account. The best results occur in the flow state when tasks are balanced—challenging enough to engage, yet not so overwhelming that they cause stress or anxiety.</p></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="page-footer">Last updated in 2024</footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"title":"Motivation models","content":"### 1.
