<h4>1. Define your goal</h4>
<p>It&#x27;s OK if you don&#x27;t know yet what you want.</p>
<p>Try different things. The more you try the better you will understand what you want.</p>
<p>When you find something interesting write down what exactly you want to achieve and how to understand that you achieved it.</p>
<p>Then check if this goal drives you. If not probably it&#x27;s not your real goal. Check <a href="/notes/Goal">Goal →</a> for more details.</p>
<h4>2. Create a learning plan</h4>
<p>Write down intermediate steps, each of which you can achieve in about a week. You need to break one big goal into several steps. Step is small if you can achieve it in a day or less.</p>
<p>Then think about resources you have: how much time and money can you afford to spend on the intermediate steps?</p>
<p>Your plan must include reading (like books or manuals), thinking about the material (<a href="/notes/Feynman%20technique">Feynman technique →</a> and <a href="/notes/Spaced%20repetition">Spaced repetition →</a>) and practicing (like coding or experimenting). You <strong>need</strong> to make mistakes: this is a way how people learn.</p>
<h4>3. Create a habit of learning</h4>
<p>Allocate at least 30-60 minutes every day (depends on resources which you have).</p>
<p>The clearer your intermediate steps the easier to follow the system. Remember that system is important: regularity and plan will allow you to focus on learning instead of thinking what to do next. Check <a href="/notes/Goal%20vs%20system">Goal vs system →</a> for details.</p>
<h4>Tips</h4>
<ol>
<li>Separate planning and learning. For example, plan on Saturday and learn from Monday to Friday.</li>
<li>Have at least one day of rest every week. For example, no learning on Sunday.</li>
<li>Plan every week. You need to prepare a weekly list of small clear goals.</li>
<li>Don&#x27;t change your goals during learning days. Postpone it to planning day.</li>
<li>No multitasking during planning or learning.</li>
</ol>
