<h3>1. Types</h3>
<p>Every object has a type. Type defines what we can do with the object.</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical object: has 4d representation in space and time, object is finite.</li>
<li>Class: a set of objects which are grouped using some property value.</li>
<li>Tuple: it&#x27;s 3 items: object, relation, another object. Order is important.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&#x27;t forget to clarify what this word is referring to. It may be a source for an error: you may use the same word as your colleague but have a different object in your mind.</p>
<h3>2. Explanation</h3>
<p>Desired properties of an explanation:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is close to reality: we can explain something with narrow classes or physical objects.</li>
<li>It has details.</li>
<li>Refutability: we know in which circumstances our explanation will be false. The more such ways we find the better. To find the ways we need to answer the following question: what should happen to make our explanation false?</li>
</ol>
<p>Mnemonic technique: it&#x27;s easier to remember facts if we put the facts into a narrative (story): <em>somebody</em> doing <em>something</em>. Something is your facts.</p>
<h3>3. Roles</h3>
<p>Each role has:</p>
<ol>
<li>Objects of interest: what objects are picked out from background.</li>
<li>Preferences.</li>
<li>Intentions: what the role is going to do with its objects of interest to satisfy its preferences.</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. Goal-oriented communication</h3>
<h4>4.1. Think pragmatically</h4>
<p>The main idea is to think about communication pragmatically. It means to define a goal  for your communication. It may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>to make this amount of fun</li>
<li>to socialise</li>
<li>to solve a specific problem</li>
</ul>
<h4>4.2. Think from one role</h4>
<p>It means you need to understand your objects of interest, preferences and you are going to act according to the preferences.</p>
<h4>4.3. Think about your partner&#x27;s role</h4>
<p>You need to understand your partner&#x27;s objects of interest, preferences and what they are going to do about it.</p>
<h4>4.4. Both parties need to agree about their communication goal</h4>
<p>And they need to do according to the goal, not to something else.</p>
<h4>4.5. Amount of information and its relevance to the goal</h4>
<p>There may be too many or too small information and that&#x27;s why it may be difficult to understand all. Also some information may be not relevant to the goal and hence must be omitted.</p>
<h4>4.6. Quality of information and its truthyness</h4>
<h4>4.7. Make sure you both refer to the same objects</h4>
<p>It make sense to agree about terms if you talk about new topic.</p>
<h3>5. Communication failures</h3>
<h4>5. 1. Communication was ended by another person</h4>
<ul>
<li>goal is not clear for another person: talk about what another person wants from the communication.</li>
<li>goal is clear for another person but it&#x27;s value is less than efforts: ask another person if it&#x27;s true.</li>
<li>another person lost their attention: give them time to recover.</li>
</ul>
<h4>5.2. Communication is continuing but you haven&#x27;t reached your goal</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>you</em> have an illusion of a common goal: talk if you have a common goal.</li>
<li>another person changes their role: need to ask which role are they playing at the moment or ask if they are talking from <em>this</em> role; you may also ask what is the most interesting things for them here.</li>
<li>object of communication is not clear or language is not clear: talk about what these words reference to.</li>
</ul>
