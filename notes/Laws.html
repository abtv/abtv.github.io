<p>People tend to attribute greater accuracy to the opinions of authority figures and are more easily influenced by them.</p>
<h3>Brooks&#x27; law</h3>
<p>Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</p>
<h3>Confirmation bias</h3>
<p>People tend to select facts that confirm their point of view and ignore those that contradict it.</p>
<h3>Conway&#x27;s law</h3>
<p>Organisations which design systems  are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organisations.</p>
<h3>Goodhart&#x27;s law</h3>
<p>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.</p>

<h3>Parkinson&#x27;s law</h3>
<p>An observation that the duration of a task expands to fill its allotted time span, regardless of the amount of work to be done.
Members of an organisation give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.</p>
<h3>Peter principle</h3>
<p>Employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another.</p></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="page-footer">Last updated in 2024</footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"title":"Laws","content":"### Authority bias\n  People tend to attribute greater accuracy to the opinions of authority figures and are more easily influenced by them.\n\n### Brooks' law\n  Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.\n\n### Confirmation bias\n  People tend to select facts that confirm their point of view and ignore those that contradict it.\n\n### Conway's law\n  Organisations which design systems  are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organisations.\n\n### Goodhart's law\n  When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\n\n### Little's law\n  The long-term average number **L** of customers in a stationary system is equal to the long-term average effective arrival rate **λ** multiplied by the average time **W** that a customer spends in the system.\n\n### Occam’s Razor\n  The simplest solution is most likely the right one.\n\n### Order of Priorities\n  1.
