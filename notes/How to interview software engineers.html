<h3>1. Define your goal as an employer</h3>
<p><code>Write down what you expect from a new employee for this particular role.</code></p>
<p>For example, I may like to see:</p>
<ol>
<li>Experience in distributed systems:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If we use relational databases I will look for experience with optimistic and pessimistic locking.</li>
<li>If we use microservices and asynchronous events I will look for experience with logic implemented in an idempotent way.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Communication skills:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Ability and desire to manage a working conflict and come to a solution.</li>
<li>Ability and desire to push back when necessary.</li>
<li>Strive for team results over individual results.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Important: pay attention only to job-required skills. Prepare a plan what you are going to ask.</code></p>
<h3>2. Study resume</h3>
<ul>
<li>Analyse logic behind a career track of a candidate.</li>
<li>Analyse what the candidate interested in and how deep his knowledge in the area.</li>
<li>Analyse how the candidate studies new things.</li>
<li>Analyse if complexity of their projects was rising.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Interview</h3>
<h4>3.1. Introduce yourself, your company, and your team</h4>
<p>Make sure we are on the same page.</p>
<h4>3.2. Describe how you are going to structure the interview</h4>
<p>This will help you both to know what to expect and when.</p>
<h4>3.3. Ask questions</h4>
<p>The assessment of skills.</p>
<h4>3.4. Give a candidate time to ask you questions</h4>
<p>Interview is a mutual process.</p>
<h3>4. Write down notes on the candidate</h3>
<p>This is not just go/no go, we need to write a small note on each required skill.
Later it will help to compare candidates if we have several of them.</p>
<h2>Important details</h2>
<h3>Ask open questions</h3>
<p>It is better to ask open questions than closed ones, at least for middle-level positions and higher: you will see how many aspects your candidate may reason about and you can always ask specific questions when needed.</p>
<h3>Examples of open questions</h3>
<h4>1. Technical open questions</h4>
<p>You goal here is to assess breadth and depth of candidate&#x27;s technical skills. Remember: you need to match it to your job requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>When to use and when to avoid michroservice architecture?</li>
<li>What was the most interesting project you was working on?</li>
<li>What was the most challenging task you solved recently?</li>
<li>Your manager asks you to help with a legacy code with many bugs. What are you going to do?</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Communication open questions</h4>
<p>You goal here is to understand how your candidate works in a team.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are working on a task and you realise it&#x27;s much harder than you expected. What you are going to do about it?</li>
<li>You need to learn something new. What will you do?</li>
<li>Our important client complains that our application works slow and your manager asks you to help. What you are going to do?</li>
