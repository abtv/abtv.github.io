<p>Figure out how this candidate matches to these requirements. Yes, you need to know why you need a new person on your team and what you expect from the person: what to know and what to do.</p>
<h3>Ask open questions</h3>
<p>It is better to ask open questions than closed ones, at least for middle-level positions and higher: you will see how many aspects your candidate may reason about and you can always ask specific questions when needed.</p>
<h3>Examples of open questions</h3>
<h4>1. Technical open questions</h4>
<p>You goal here is to assess breadth and depth of candidate&#x27;s technical skills. Remember: you need to match it to your job requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>When to use and when to avoid michroservice architecture?</li>
<li>What was the most interesting project you was working on?</li>
<li>What was the most challenging task you solved recently?</li>
<li>Your manager asks you to help with a legacy code with many bugs. What are you going to do?</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Soft-skills open questions</h4>
<p>You goal here is to understand how your candidate works in a team.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are working on a task and you realise it&#x27;s much harder than you expected. What you are going to do about it?</li>
<li>You need to learn something new. What will you do?</li>
<li>Our important client complains that our application works slow and your manager asks you to help. What you are going to do?</li>
