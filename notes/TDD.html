<p>Test driven development (TDD) reduces feedback cycle time and allows to work in small iterations which makes development easier.</p>
<h3>How to use TDD?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Define an acceptance criteria and write a test.
It may be a unit test or an e2e test. It is easier to start with a unit test but if your tasks are small enough (up to 1-2 days of work) it will be also not difficult to write an e2e test first as well. Make sure the test fails.</li>
<li>Write an implementation. Make sure the test passes.</li>
<li>Refactor if necessary.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ol>
<li>Usage of TDD makes sense if you can run your test in up to 5-20 seconds. If it takes longer you need to reduce the time first. The main advantage of TDD for me is that I can think about my task in terms of an actual result and edge cases.
When I know what exactly needs to be implemented I can go to implementation.</li>
<li>I don&#x27;t try to design programs using TDD. The main benefit for me is a clear automated acceptance criteria and small
amount of code I need to write to implement logic for the acceptance criteria.</li>
<li>I use e2e tests for testing the whole system and unit tests for testing business logic in isolation.
I need both of these types of tests.</li>
