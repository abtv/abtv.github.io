<ol>
<li>I feel drive and have a sense of an achievement and I start to work and at the same time start to ignore other spheres of my life.</li>
<li>I constantly feel that I&#x27;m tired.</li>
<li>I constantly feel that I&#x27;m tired and start to have diseases related to my professional activity.</li>
<li>I feel that I hate my profession and other people who I work with. This is a point of no return.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Go one stage up: from 3 to 2, from 2 to 1.
If I&#x27;m at stage 3 it&#x27;s useless to use treatment for stage 2.</p>
<h3>1st stage treatment</h3>
<p>Admit that I have an addiction then change my beliefs (only people who work a lot are successful, etc).</p>
<h3>2nd stage treatment</h3>
<p>Regularly have a rest.
How do I know that I have enough rest? It&#x27;s NOT about time (you may need 1 hour brake but I may need less or more), it&#x27;s about when I feel I&#x27;m recovered.
How to take a rest? Don&#x27;t learn new things related to work, don&#x27;t learn new languages, etc. Just forget about my work.</p>
<h3>3rd stage treatment</h3>
<p>Take a sabbatical. Usually it&#x27;s from 3 to 6 months.</p>
<h3>4th stage treatment</h3>
<p>Change profession.</p>
<h3>What to remember when I feel bad</h3>
<p>I&#x27;m more than just a professional.</p></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="page-footer">Last updated in 2024</footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"title":"Emotional burnout","content":"### 4 stages of emotional burnout\n1.
