<p>When you start a company with 2-3 engineers usually you don&#x27;t need event driven systems. It makes sense to use an async architecture if you have a big apllication and several teams working on it. Linkedin created Kafka to cope with their growth.</p>
<h3>Commands, events, and queries</h3>
<p>Command is an action that must be performed by remote service in a synchronous manner.</p>
<p>Event is a business fact that something happened. Usually it makes sense to persist a business fact. Producer sends an event and forgets about it.</p>
<p>Query is a request to get data. Query doesn&#x27;t change state.</p>
<h3>Kafka</h3>
<p>We can use Kafka streams to query necessary data. Several streams can be combined to create a new stream.</p>
<p>Kafka stores data locally to avoid network calls. Kafka is distributed so it will continue working if a partition fails.</p>
