<ol>
<li>JavaScript is run in a single thread with V8 engine.</li>
<li>I/O is implemented with libuv library.</li>
<li>C++ addons for low-level operations like compression or encryption.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Difference between network and file I/O</h3>
<ol>
<li>Network I/O uses operating system notification mechanisms.</li>
<li>Thread pool is used for file I/O because file operations are blocking in libuv. Libuv developers decided to simplify file I/O implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE</code> is used to set number of threads in the pool. By default the thread pool has 4 threads. The threadpool is also used for compression and encryption.</p>
<h3>Event loop</h3>
<p>Event loop consists of several phases. Each phase has a FIFO queue of callbacks. Phase is finished when either all callback were called or when a sertain limit of calls was reached.</p>
<ol>
<li>Timers: executes callbacks scheduled with setTimeout and setInterval.</li>
<li>Pending callbacks: executes callbacks deferred to the next iteration (due to a limit of calls).</li>
<li>Idle, prepare: used internally.</li>
<li>Poll: retrieves new I/O events and execute all I/O callbacks (except socket closing).</li>
<li>Check: executes callbacks scheduled with setImmediate. Useful in I/O callbacks to run something right after poll phase was finished.</li>
<li>Close callbacks: socket close callbacks.

</ol>
<h3>process.nextTick</h3>
<p>nextTick callback is executed right after current operation finishes before other callbacks in a queue. In this sense setImmediate should be called nextTick.</p>
<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>Node.js memory consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Call stack</li>
<li>Heap</li>
</ol>
<p>By default, memory limit is 1.4 Gb (different versions of Node have different limits). <code>--max-old-space-size</code> allows to change the limit.</p>
<h3>Garbage collector</h3>
<p>Heap separated into two spaces:</p>
<ol>
<li>New space. Usually from 1 to 8 Mb. Garbage collection is performed frequently here.</li>
<li>Old space. Garbage collection is rare here.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cluster mode</h3>
<p>Cluster mode is a mode when the main process is forked as many times as we need (usually equals to the number of cores).</p>
<p>Forked processes reuse the same port of an HTTP server.</p>
<h3>Node.js ORMs</h3>
<p>ORM is a library which allows to work with relational databases in object-oriented languages.</p>
<h4>TypeORM</h4>
<p>Implements data mapper pattern: model object doesn&#x27;t know about persistance and has data fields and business logic. Repositories are used for CRUD operations.</p>
<h4>Sequelize</h4>
<p>Follows active record pattern: model object has data fields, business logic and database CRUD functions.</p>
<h4>Prisma</h4>
<p>Query builder. Generates data types from a schema definition. Uses typed functions almost everywhere. Prisma objects have only data, there is no behavior. Almost no raw queries.</p>
