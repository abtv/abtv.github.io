<ol>
<li>Self-awareness</li>
<li>Self-regulation</li>
<li>Empathy</li>
<li>Social skill</li>
</ol>
<h3>Self-awareness</h3>
<p>Ability to understand your own emotions and what caused them.</p>
<p>This helps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe your emotions in a diary. Do it every day.</li>
<li>Analyze which body sensations correspond to a particular emotion.</li>
<li>Analyze what other people feel when you read books or watch movies.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Self-regulation</h3>
<p>Use understanding of your own emotions for a more agile behavior.</p>
<p>This helps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take care about your physical health.</li>
<li>Use the breathing technique: breath in, hold, breath out, hold, repeat at least 10 times.</li>
<li>Remember that you are responsible for your own actions, not other people&#x27;s actions.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Empathy</h3>
<p>Ability to understand other people&#x27;s emotions, what caused them and (possibly) share them.</p>
<p>This helps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sincerely pay attention to other people. If possible listen more and talk less.</li>
<li>Plan some questions in advance and ask them.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Social skills</h3>
<p>Managing relationships to get along with others.</p>
<p>This helps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Invest your time in other people.</li>
<li>Try to understand a situation from another person&#x27;s perspective.</li>
